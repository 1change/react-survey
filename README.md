# React Survey

Right now, there are many tutorial react apps to show how to make it work with redux and react, but these apps do not help to learn how to handle a real project. Survey or questionaier is a well-known problem. React Survey is a project show how to use redux and react build a more complicated web application. 

See live demo [here](https://react-survey.herokuapp.com)

## Run

```
npm install
npm start
```

## Use Redux

Redux is a well-known flux style state management framework. Learn more from [http://redux.js.org/](http://redux.js.org/)

## Use PouchDB

[PouchDB](https://pouchdb.com/) is an open-source JavaScript database. PouchDB was created to help web developers build applications that work as well offline as they do online. I use PouchDB here as a fake backend. If someone really want to make React Survey a service to collect surveys, please implement the API in `src/api`.

## Use create react app

[create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) to Create React apps with no build configuration.
