## Use RAML to description backend api

[RAML](http://raml.org). RESTful API Modeling Language (RAML) makes it easy to manage the whole API lifecycle from design to sharing. It's concise - you only write what you need to define - and reusable. It is machine readable API design that is actually human friendly. And there is an implementation of this backend api at [https://github.com/aisensiy/react-survey-backend](https://github.com/aisensiy/react-survey-backend);

## Use create react app
